   How to find 50 stars repo to contribute a favourote repo?<br>
   Uh' It simple way : Just put the text in your github Search bar repo  stars:>=50  !! <br>

   Please search on your Github home page instead of perticular repo  because it will search only on your perticular repo.
   
   Also Keep in mind,<br>
   You can't use the following wildcard characters as part of your search query: . , : ; / \ ` ' " = * ! ? # $ & + ^ | ~ < > ( ) { } [ ]. The search will simply ignore these symbols.
